## R Markdown- Cleaning Capstone Data

This document details the processes and code used to clean the Mental Health Survey (2014) [Data Set](www.kaggle.com/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey). This data set contains 1259 observations and 27 variables. This data set was obtained from the Open Source Mental Illness Project (on the Kaggle website)

Before beginning any analyses, the raw data set was reviewed to determine what cleaning/manipulating was needed. Several issues were noted including:

* *Gender variable*-- multiple misspellings, multiple forms to represent one gender (e.g. M, or m, Male for Male) as well as a number of other gender representations (Cis, femme-male, trans)

* *Wellness, Anonymity, Coworkers, Care Options, Supervisor, Coworker, Seek _Help variables* required some cleaning as the levels within the variable frequently had spaces (e.g. "Don't know")

* *State variable*-- many missing values due to responses from foreign respondents

* *Number of Employees and Age variables*-- numeric errors present (e.g. 999 for an age)

The following is the code for cleaning each variable :


#### Gender Variable

```{r warning = FALSE, error = FALSE, eval=FALSE}

read_csv("survey.csv")
b<- as.factor(survey$Gender)
levels(b)

```

#### Care_Options Variable

```{r warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
