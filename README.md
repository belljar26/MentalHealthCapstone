# MentalHealthCapstone
This project uses data from Open Source Mental Illness (OSMI)data set available on Kaggle.com. The OSMI includes information on 1259 respondents, their demographic information, basic company information, remote work status and beliefs about mental illness in the workplace. In addition, respondents answered questions about their family history with mental illness and treatment seeking. The files in this repository include the code for the data wrangling, EDA, as well as the logistic regression and CART models. In addition sentiment analysis was attempted on the very small sample of qualitative comments.

The project proposal, final report and slide deck provide information on the problem, formulation of the research questions, discussion of data wrangling steps, findings and recommendations. The cleaned data set (and original data set) are also provided as well as the code for each component of the project.
